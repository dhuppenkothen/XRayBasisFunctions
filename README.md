Modelling X-ray Spectra with Gaussian Basis Functions
=====================================================

or: how to make X-ray spectral modelling people really sad.

This is a basic proof-of-concept.

It's not pretty, but it seems to work, and sometimes it's all 
we care about. Even better, we can do this in native Python, 
which means I don't have to worry about compiling XSPEC models.
